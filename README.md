# actions-phpcs
PHPCS action for GitHub on PHP 8.1

## Setup
Add these lines to your YAML config file
```yaml
- name: PHP Code Style (phpcs)
  uses: vasilevIT/actions-phpcs@master
```

**WARNING** : Be sure you have this line **before** :
```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v2
```

Your workflow file should look like this:
```yaml
name: phpcs
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: PHP Code Style (phpcs)
        uses: vasilevIT/actions-phpcs@master
        with:
          # Folder to check code style
          dir: src/
```

**TIP**: You can replace `@master` by `@1.0.0` or any specific version of this
package you'd like to use.

### Rules
By default, `phpcs` will look for a `phpcs.xml.dist` file at the root of your project.

So, make sure this file exists and has all the rules you want to apply.

If you don't want to use default configuration or add custom parameters, you can
use `cli` argument, as described below.

### Arguments
By default, `phpcs` is ran without any argument.

##### Directory
If you want, you can specify scan directory on anything else on your `phpcs.xml.dist`

You can also specify scan directory by adding
```yaml	
  with:	
    dir: './src' 
```

##### CLI arguments
You can also add custom CLI arguments if you want.
```yaml
    with:
        cli: '--version'
```

Note that your arguments must be valid and include `-` or `--`.
The CLI string will be added to executed PHPCS CLI, just after the directory to scan.
